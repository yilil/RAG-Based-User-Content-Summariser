    {"id": 201, "question": "I recently started learning Python and have completed basic tutorials covering syntax, loops, functions, and object-oriented programming. I’ve also built a few small projects like a calculator app and a simple web scraper. My goal is to become proficient in data science, so I started looking into NumPy and pandas.

Should I focus on mastering SQL first, dive into statistics, or start learning machine learning frameworks like Scikit-Learn? What would be the best approach?", "category": "5"},
    {"id": 202, "question": "I am developing a mobile app using React Native. So far, I have implemented user authentication with Firebase, designed a clean UI, and integrated REST APIs to fetch and display data. However, as my app grows, managing state has become increasingly complex, leading to performance issues and redundant re-renders. I have read about different state management solutions like Redux, Context API, and Recoil, but I am not sure which one would be the best for my case. Should I adopt Redux for scalability, or is there a simpler solution that works well for mid-sized apps? What should be my next step?", "category": "5"},
