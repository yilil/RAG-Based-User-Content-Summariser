    {"id": 41, "question": "I have been trying to improve my website's SEO for months. I started by optimizing meta tags, improving page speed, and ensuring mobile responsiveness. Then, I focused on generating high-quality backlinks through guest posts and social media promotion. Recently, I even started producing long-form blog content with relevant keywords. However, despite these efforts, my website’s rankings on Google have not improved significantly. I'm not sure whether I should focus more on technical SEO, content marketing, or something else. What should I do next?", "category": "5"},
    {"id": 42, "question": "I recently started learning Python and have completed basic tutorials covering syntax, loops, functions, and object-oriented programming. I’ve also built a few small projects like a calculator app and a simple web scraper. My goal is to become proficient in data science, so I started looking into NumPy and pandas. However, I feel overwhelmed by the number of topics in machine learning and data analysis. Should I focus on mastering SQL first, dive into statistics, or start learning machine learning frameworks like Scikit-Learn? What would be the best approach?", "category": "5"},
    {"id": 43, "question": "I am developing a mobile app using React Native. So far, I have implemented user authentication with Firebase, designed a clean UI, and integrated REST APIs to fetch and display data. However, as my app grows, managing state has become increasingly complex, leading to performance issues and redundant re-renders. I have read about different state management solutions like Redux, Context API, and Recoil, but I am not sure which one would be the best for my case. Should I adopt Redux for scalability, or is there a simpler solution that works well for mid-sized apps? What should be my next step?", "category": "5"},
    {"id": 44, "question": "I launched my e-commerce store three months ago, selling handmade crafts. I’ve set up a professional-looking website, optimized product descriptions, and run Facebook and Google ads to drive traffic. I also implemented discounts and free shipping offers to encourage purchases. My site gets a decent number of visitors daily, but the conversion rate remains low. I’ve already tested different product images, tweaked pricing, and simplified the checkout process. What should I analyze or change next to improve sales?", "category": "5"},
    {"id": 45, "question": "I have been working on a machine learning project for fraud detection in financial transactions. I collected a dataset with labeled fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions, performed extensive feature engineering, and trained a logistic regression model as a baseline. However, the model’s accuracy is lower than expected, and precision-recall metrics indicate a high false positive rate. I’m debating whether to try a more complex model like Random Forest or XGBoost, gather more training data, or focus on fine-tuning feature selection. What would be the best next step?", "category": "5"},
    {"id": 46, "question": "I am managing a small software development team, and we have been facing issues with missed deadlines, inefficient communication, and unstructured workflows. We follow Agile methodologies with sprint planning, daily standups, and retrospectives, but the productivity remains low. Some developers complain about unclear requirements, while others struggle with task prioritization. I am considering implementing a stricter sprint process, investing in better project management tools, or even hiring a dedicated project manager. What changes should I make to improve my team's efficiency?", "category": "5"},
    {"id": 47, "question": "I started a YouTube channel six months ago, consistently posting high-quality videos on technology reviews. My views have been growing steadily, and some videos even performed well, but my subscriber count is increasing at a much slower rate than expected. I have experimented with different video formats, improved my thumbnails, and optimized my video descriptions with relevant keywords. However, I’m unsure whether I should focus more on collaborations, YouTube Shorts, or audience engagement strategies like live Q&A sessions. What should be my next move to accelerate subscriber growth?", "category": "5"},
    {"id": 48, "question": "I am writing a research paper on AI ethics. I have conducted a thorough literature review covering algorithmic bias, data privacy concerns, and policy regulations. However, I am struggling to find a unique angle that hasn’t been widely discussed already. I want my research to contribute something new rather than repeating existing discussions. Should I focus on case studies of real-world AI failures, explore the ethical implications of AI in specific industries, or propose a new ethical framework? How can I refine my research direction?", "category": "5"},
    {"id": 49, "question": "I have been practicing competitive programming for a while and have solved many beginner-level problems on platforms like LeetCode and Codeforces. However, I consistently struggle with dynamic programming and graph algorithms. I find it difficult to identify when to apply certain techniques and often get stuck during contests. I have tried watching tutorials and reading solutions, but I still struggle with problem-solving under time constraints. Should I focus on more hands-on practice, analyze past contest problems, or follow a structured course on algorithms? What is the best way to improve in these areas?", "category": "5"},
    {"id": 50, "question": "I co-founded a startup and built an MVP for a SaaS product. We have a small but active group of early adopters, and we’ve been gathering feedback to refine the product. However, growth has been slow, and I am unsure whether we should prioritize improving our product features, investing more in marketing, or pivoting our business model slightly. We have tried digital ads and content marketing, but customer acquisition remains costly. What should be our next move to achieve sustainable growth?", "category": "5"},
