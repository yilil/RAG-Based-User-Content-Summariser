# NextGen-AI
The goal of this project is to develop a system that combines information retrieval and generative AI for more efficient processing of knowledge tasks.
The system is capable of retrieving relevant information from a large number of documents or knowledge bases and generating accurate and useful content for scenarios such as Q&A and summarization.
The target knowledge base sources are Little Red Book and Stack Overflow.
